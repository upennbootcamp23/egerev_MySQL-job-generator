## Installation

The following packages have to be installed:
1. Node.js
2. Inquirer ver. 8.2.4 - used to accept user input
3. MySQL2 - used to connect to the database 

## Usage

The project is Node.js-based, which means that the Terminal had to be used in order to do everything. When the user starts the menu, he/she is presented with a list of options. The user picks an option and works with the option, answering the given questions. If the user hits exit, the program ends.

NOTE: This project is connected with the MySQL database, so the database (in MySQL) HAS TO BE OPEN.

## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work.

1. After getting some well-needed rest, my colleague Leo helped me out with the project. His help is shown all over the project. 

2. Creating relationships in MySQL is just as hard as in real life. However, Stack Overflow made this look easy. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/260441/how-to-create-relationships-in-mysql)

3. All indexes start with 0, right? However, I had to know how to get the index value from Inquirer. Stack Overflow helped me out with this. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65415706/how-to-get-index-value-of-choice-made-with-inquirer)

4. When I tried creating the database in MySQL, the message "SELECT * FROM..." kept appearing in the table. How did I get rid of it? By adding "SELECT * FROM ... AS ...". That was thanks to Stack Overflow. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/614238/how-can-i-rename-a-single-column-in-a-table-at-select)

5. This program also used the Table package, as shown in this documentation. (//https://www.npmjs.com/package/table)

5. MySQL and Node.js go hand-in-hand together. How? This link provides the answer.(https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_mysql.asp)

Other than that, I can safely say that the content of this project is my own, original work.
